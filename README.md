# news-sentiment-tracker
A lightweight Python script that scrapes real-time news headlines from RSS feeds (like Google News), filters them by user-defined keywords, and performs sentiment analysis using NLP libraries such as TextBlob. The results are visualized in bar charts and can optionally be saved to CSV for future use.
